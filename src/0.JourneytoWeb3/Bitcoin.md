Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is completely virtual.

Bitcoins exist hidden within the exchange of value between senders and recipients. Bitcoin users have keys that allow them to prove within the Bitcoin network that they have authority to transact bitcoins, which can then be spent, bought, sold and exchanged for other currencies once decrypted. Due to Bitcoin's fast, secure and borderless nature, in some sense Bitcoin represents the perfect form of an internet currency.

Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer network system. Therefore, there are no "central" servers or central points of control.

Bitcoin pioneered a solution to the problem of distributed computing.

Satoshi Nakamoto's invention was also a feasible solution to the "Byzantine Generals Problem", an unsolved problem in distributed computing. In simple terms, the problem involves trying to achieve consensus on an action protocol through communication within an untrustworthy network that has potential threats. Nakamoto's solution was to achieve consensus without a central authority using the concept of proof-of-work, which represented a breakthrough in distributed computing science and has far surpassed mere currency applicability.

There is a lot of information about Bitcoin online, so I won't go into a detailed introduction here.
