## Web3

Web3 is the next generation of the Internet. It aims to bring more decentralization, security and transparency to our online world. Imagine that the current Internet (what we call Web2) is largely controlled by a few large companies, while Web3 attempts to decentralize power and control to users. This means that in the Web3 world, users have more control over their own data and identities, rather than giving them completely to companies like Google and Facebook.

The core technology of Web3 is blockchain, a decentralized and secure distributed database. You can think of the blockchain as a public ledger that records everyone's transactions and activities and cannot be tampered with once recorded. Blockchain-based applications such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (Dapps) are an important part of Web3.

Let's use an example to illustrate how Web3 changes the existing Internet. In Web2, if artists want to sell their works online, they usually have to rely on some centralized platforms (such as eBay and Amazon). These platforms often charge high fees and control the user's trading process. In the Web3 world, artists can sell their works on decentralized markets (such as OpenSea). Here, artists can turn their works into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and sell them directly to buyers without third-party intervention. In this way, artists can get greater returns and have more control over transactions.

Web3 also provides better protection for online privacy. On today's Internet, users' data and privacy are often easily compromised. In Web3, users can ensure the security of their data through encryption and self-managed identities. This makes the entire network more secure and reliable.

Web3 is the new era of the Internet based on blockchain technology. It redistributes power and control back to users, increases security and transparency. Through decentralized applications and services, Web3 is poised to change the way we interact with the Internet and create a fairer, freer online world.



## Smart contract

Smart contracts are like automatically executed digital contracts. It defines a set of prewritten rules. Once these rules are met, the smart contract will automatically execute the corresponding operations. It is based on blockchain technology, which means it is decentralized, secure, and cannot be modified once deployed. Simply put, a smart contract is a piece of automatically executed computer program that ensures that the parties can complete transactions, sign contracts, etc. without a third party.

It's like a vending machine where you put in 5 dollars and same worth of drinks.

Imagine you and your friend bet on which football team will win the match. In real life, you may need to find a reliable third party to hold the stakes. But with smart contracts, you can create a program to replace this third party. This program will receive your stakes and automatically pay out the winnings after the match based on the match result. In this way, there is no need for a real person to be involved, and you don't have to worry about the other party being dishonest.

Smart contracts have a wide range of applications such as finance, real estate, insurance, etc. For example, imagine an insurance company. If you purchase flight delay insurance and your flight is actually delayed, you usually need to submit some materials and wait for the insurance company's approval. However, if there is a smart contract-based insurance system, as long as your flight information is confirmed to be delayed, the smart contract will automatically execute and immediately pay you compensation. In this way, the whole process becomes simpler, more efficient and transparent.

A smart contract is an automatically executed, blockchain-based digital contract. It can streamline processes, improve efficiency and ensure transaction security in various scenarios.



## DApp

A DApp (Decentralized Application) is an application that runs on a blockchain network and is not controlled by any centralized entity. This means that no single company or individual can fully control it. The design of DApps makes them more secure, transparent and reliable because their data and operations are based on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized, tamper-proof distributed database.

Imagine you are using a centralized social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). These platforms control your data and privacy, and they can arbitrarily change rules, censor content or even sell your information. DApps, on the other hand, provide you with a decentralized social media platform that is not controlled by any centralized entity, allowing you to manage your own data and privacy.

A great example of a DApp is a cryptocurrency exchange. In traditional centralized exchanges (such as Coinbase or Binance), users' funds and transaction information are stored on the exchange's servers. However, decentralized exchanges (DEXs, such as Uniswap) are DApps based on blockchain technology that allow users to directly trade digital currencies without involving a third party. In this way, users can enjoy higher privacy and autonomy while keeping their funds secure.

In addition to exchanges, DApps have many other use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, games, markets, etc. These decentralized applications provide users with a freer, more secure and transparent Internet environment.

DApps are decentralized applications based on blockchain technology that are free from the control of centralized entities. By using DApps, users can better protect their data and privacy while enjoying higher security and transparency. DApps are a key part of the Web3 era, and together they help build a fairer, more secure Internet future.

## All in / Show hand

Going all in on something or betting everything you have. In poker, "all in" or "show hand" refers to a player betting all of their chips. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy because a player can either win all of their opponents' chips at once or lose all of their chips.

Imagine you're participating in a game of Texas Hold'em. Players sit around a table with chips in their hands. In each round of the game, you need to determine your chances of winning based on the cards in your hand and the public cards on the table. If you think your hand is very good and you have a high chance of winning, you may choose to go "all in" and bet all your chips. This way, you may win the pot for that round or scare other players into not following suit.

However, going "all in" also carries a lot of risk. If your opponent has a better hand, you could lose all your chips and be eliminated. Therefore, going "all in" is a strategy that requires careful consideration by the player. Before deciding to go "all in", you need to weigh factors such as the odds of winning, the size of the pot, the behaviour patterns of your opponents, etc.

In addition, the concept of "all in" is often used in real life to describe an attitude of taking risks and putting all your effort into something. When a person puts all their savings and energy into their own business venture at a crucial moment to pursue success or achieve their dreams, we can also say that they have gone "all in". For example, an entrepreneur who decides to invest all of their savings and efforts into their own business project demonstrates an "all in" spirit.

"All in" or "show hand" is a term originating from poker that refers to a player betting all their chips. It is both a high-risk, high-reward strategy and an attitude of daring to take risks and forge ahead. In real life, the "all in" spirit encourages us to courageously pursue our goals at critical moments, overcome difficulties and give it our all.



## ECDSA

ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is an encryption technology used to ensure data security and integrity. Its principle is to generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key, through elliptic curve cryptography. The public key is open and can be shared with others, while the private key is kept secret and known only to the key owner. This encryption method can help us securely send information over the network and verify the source of data.

Imagine you are sending a letter to a friend. To ensure the security of the letter, you need to put it in a locked box. In this example, ECDSA is like a special lock: lock the box with your private key, and this lock can only be opened with your public key. This way, when your friend receives the letter, they can use your public key to open the box, verify that the letter was sent from you and has not been tampered with.

ECDSA has a wide range of applications in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECDSA as their encryption and digital signature standard. In these systems, a user's private key is used to sign transactions, while the public key is used to verify transactions. This ensures the security and integrity of transactions and prevents others from forging or tampering with transactions.

An important feature of ECDSA is that it provides a high level of security while requiring relatively low computing resources and storage space. This makes it very useful in cryptocurrencies and other security-sensitive applications. However, ECDSA also has some limitations, such as its inability to resist quantum computing attacks. Therefore, as technology progresses, new encryption methods may be needed in the future to protect our data security.

ECDSA is an encryption technology based on elliptic curve cryptography to ensure data security and integrity. It plays an important role in network communication and cryptocurrencies, helping us protect information and verify the source of data. Although it has certain limitations, ECDSA remains a key encryption technology for many current applications.



## BLS

BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signature is an encryption technology whose main advantage is the ability to achieve highly efficient aggregate signatures. This means that multiple signatures can be aggregated into a single signature, greatly reducing storage and transmission overhead. BLS signatures have been widely used in blockchain, distributed systems and cryptography research.

Suppose a group of people work together to complete a project, and each person needs to sign the project report. In traditional signature methods, each person needs to sign the report separately, which takes up a lot of space. However, using BLS signatures, this group of people can aggregate their signatures into a compact signature, greatly reducing the volume of the report. This way, the verifier only needs to check this aggregate signature to ensure that all participants have signed.

BLS signatures have important applications in the blockchain field, especially in some decentralized consensus algorithms, such as Ethereum 2.0's consensus protocol. In these systems, nodes need to sign transactions or blocks to express their consensus. By using BLS signatures, the signatures of multiple nodes can be aggregated into one signature, thereby reducing network transmission and storage overhead. This helps to improve the scalability and performance of the blockchain.

BLS signature is an efficient encryption technology that can aggregate multiple signatures into a compact signature. This method saves storage space and transmission bandwidth and improves system performance. In the fields of blockchain and distributed systems, BLS signatures play an important role in enabling more efficient and scalable consensus mechanisms.



## Merkle Tree

A Merkle tree is a tree data structure used to store and verify data integrity. You can think of it as a tree where each node has a hash value calculated from the hash values of its child nodes. The bottom layer (leaf nodes) of the tree stores the hash values of the actual data.

For example, suppose we have four files: A, B, C and D. We first calculate the hash values of these four files, resulting in hash values HA, HB, HC and HD. Then we combine these hash values in pairs and calculate their hash values, e.g. combine HA and HB to calculate the new hash value HAB; similarly, combine HC and HD to get the hash value HCD. Finally, we combine HAB and HCD to get the root node hash value HABCD. In this way, the entire Merkle tree is constructed.

So what are the advantages of Merkle trees? First, it can quickly verify data integrity. To check if file A has been tampered with, we only need to calculate the hash value of A and then verify that the root node hash value is correct through the other nodes of the tree (such as HB and HCD). In this way, we can check the integrity of the data without obtaining the complete data. This is very useful for distributed systems and blockchain technologies.

Second, Merkle trees can also efficiently improve data storage efficiency. Because each node stores the hash values of its child nodes, we can calculate the hash values layer by layer to find a piece of data. This avoids the time consumption of traversing the entire dataset.

In summary, the Merkle tree is a very practical data structure that can efficiently verify and store data, especially suitable for distributed systems and blockchain technologies. Like a tree, the root node contains the information of the whole tree, and by simply calculating hash values, we can easily ensure data integrity.



## Gas fee

When you want to complete a transaction or call a smart contract on the blockchain network, you need to pay a certain fee. This fee is called the gas fee.

Why is this fee required? This is to provide some incentives for the "miners" who provide computing power to the blockchain network. Miners are responsible for verifying transactions, ensuring the legality of transactions, and bundling transactions into blocks. To incentivize them to work, users need to pay gas fees to them.

The price of gas fees on Ethereum fluctuates depending on the volume of transactions on the network. When many people are using the blockchain network, gas fees will rise, just like taxi fares become more expensive during rush hour traffic. You can set the price of gas fees yourself, but note that if you set the price too low, miners may be unwilling to prioritize your transaction, leading to transaction delays or even failures.

On IC, gas fees are fixed and do not fluctuate arbitrarily with the network. Ordinary users can generally ignore gas fees. Learn more about gas fees here.



## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a financial service model based on blockchain technology. It aims to eliminate centralized institutions such as banks, exchanges and insurance companies in the traditional financial system. By utilizing smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, DeFi provides users with a more transparent, open and reliable financial service model.

For example, if you need a loan to purchase a new car. In the traditional financial system, you need to apply to a bank, and the bank will decide whether to approve your loan based on your credit score and income. This process can be both time-consuming and complicated. It can be even more difficult for those without a credit history or unable to provide sufficient collateral.

However, in the DeFi system, you can apply for a loan through a decentralized lending platform. This platform is not operated by a centralized institution but based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. You only need to pledge a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral to get a loan immediately without going through a cumbersome review process. In addition, DeFi platforms can also allow you to view the status and interest of the loan at any time, providing higher transparency.

DeFi is not limited to lending services. It also includes a series of financial products and services such as decentralized exchanges (DEX), stablecoins, asset management, prediction markets, etc. These services allow users to trade and invest directly on the blockchain without relying on traditional financial institutions.

DeFi is a financial service model based on blockchain technology. It aims to eliminate centralized institutions in the financial system and provide more transparent, open and reliable financial services. Whether in lending, trading or investment, DeFi promises to change our perception of financial services and make financial markets more inclusive and efficient.



## Liquidity Providers and Liquidity Pools

Liquidity providers (LPs) play an important role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. They help improve market liquidity by injecting assets into exchanges or decentralized platforms. In short, liquidity providers are like "plumbers" in the financial market. They ensure the smooth flow of funds in the market so that participants can easily trade.

For example, if there are many fruit stalls in the market. Customers can freely buy fruit between these stalls. However, to ensure that customers can find the fruit they want, the stall owners need to maintain sufficient inventory. This is the role of liquidity providers: they provide goods (assets in the financial market) to the market to meet trading needs.

In the decentralized finance market, liquidity providers typically inject their assets into a smart contract called a "liquidity pool". These assets can be cryptocurrencies, tokens, etc. By injecting assets into the liquidity pool, liquidity providers help platform users trade, such as token swaps and lending.

In return, liquidity providers can earn income from transaction fees. This is like fruit stand owners earning profits by selling fruit. In addition, some decentralized finance platforms will also issue reward tokens to liquidity providers to incentivize them to participate and improve market liquidity.

However, liquidity providers also face certain risks, such as "impermanent loss". This risk stems from fluctuations in the prices of assets in the liquidity pool, which may cause liquidity providers to lose value when redeeming assets. Therefore, before becoming a liquidity provider, you need to carefully evaluate the potential risks and rewards.

Liquidity providers play an important role in the decentralized finance market. By injecting assets into the market, they improve trading liquidity so that participants can trade smoothly. In return, liquidity providers can earn income from transaction fees and reward tokens. But at the same time, they also need to pay attention to potential risks such as impermanent loss.



## Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

Automated market makers (AMMs) are algorithms used in decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges to ensure trading liquidity in the market. Unlike traditional exchanges, AMMs do not require matching between buyers and sellers. Instead, AMMs automatically calculate asset trading prices through a pre-set mathematical formula.

AMMs are implemented through smart contracts and liquidity pools. Liquidity pools consist of assets injected by liquidity providers. Users can exchange assets in these pools. When a user wants to exchange two assets, the AMM calculates the exchange ratio according to a preset mathematical formula. This ratio is adjusted in real time as the transaction occurs to maintain market balance.

Uniswap is a typical decentralized exchange that adopts the AMM (automated market maker) algorithm. It uses a formula called $x*y=k$ to determine trading prices. In this formula, x and y represent the quantities of two assets in the liquidity pool respectively, while k is a constant. When users trade in the pool, the quantities of x and y change, but the k value remains unchanged. This ensures that trading prices automatically adjust to maintain market equilibrium.

Suppose we have a decentralized exchange with an AMM-based liquidity pool that allows users to exchange between two tokens (Token A and Token B). We use Uniswap's formula $x*y=k$as the AMM algorithm.

First, liquidity providers inject Token A and Token B into the liquidity pool. Assume that initially, there are 1000 Token A and 1000 Token B in the liquidity pool. According to the AMM formula, we have:

$x*y=k$

$1000*1000=1,000,000$

In this case, the constant k is 1,000,000.

Now, suppose a user wants to purchase Token B with 100 Token A. They will inject 100 Token A into the liquidity pool, bringing the quantity of Token A in the pool to 1100. To keep the constant k unchanged, we need to recalculate the quantity of Token B. According to the AMM formula:

$1100*y=1,000,000$

$y ≈ 909.09$

Therefore, there are now approximately 909.09 Token B left in the liquidity pool. The user exchanged 100 Token A for about 90.91 Token B (1000 - 909.09). In addition, transaction fees (if any) will be allocated to liquidity providers.

In this process, the AMM automatically adjusts the exchange ratio of Token A and Token B according to the preset formula. As transactions occur, token prices are adjusted in real time to maintain market equilibrium. This is the basic working principle of the AMM.

It should be noted that this example is a simplified version, and the actual operation may involve additional details such as fees and slippage. However, this example should be sufficient to help you understand the core concepts and working principles of the AMM.

The AMM brings some advantages such as simplifying the trading process, increasing market liquidity and reducing transaction latency. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as potential impermanent loss and potential price slippage.

Automated market makers (AMMs) are algorithms used in decentralized finance exchanges to ensure market liquidity. Through smart contracts and liquidity pools, AMMs can automatically calculate asset transaction prices, simplify the trading process and reduce latency. Although AMMs have certain advantages, it is also necessary to pay attention to potential risks when using them.



## GameFi

GameFi is the abbreviation of "Game Finance". It refers to the emerging trend of applying decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology to the gaming industry. In short, GameFi is an innovative way to combine gaming and finance, allowing players to earn income in virtual worlds while playing games.

Imagine that you are playing an adventure game and have obtained some virtual items and currencies in the game by completing tasks, fighting monsters, etc. Typically, these items and currencies can only be used within the game. However, in the GameFi world, these virtual items and currencies can be converted into real-world value. This is because the items and currencies in the game are often represented by cryptocurrencies (such as NFTs, non-fungible tokens) with uniqueness and scarcity, which can be traded on the blockchain.

Let's use a simple analogy to illustrate the GameFi concept. Imagine you are playing a "pet raising" game where each pet is a unique NFT. By taking care of and nurturing the pet, you can increase the attributes and skills of the pet, thereby increasing its value. In a GameFi environment, you can sell these pets in in-game or out-of-game markets in exchange for other players' cryptocurrencies. These cryptocurrencies can be traded on the blockchain and even exchanged for fiat currencies. This way, you can earn income while enjoying the fun of the game.

In addition, GameFi also encourages players to participate in game governance and ecosystem building. For example, by holding governance tokens in the game, players can participate in decision-making on the future direction and rule-setting of the game. This helps to establish a decentralized and shared game world where players become true stakeholders.

GameFi is an emerging trend of applying decentralized finance and blockchain technology to the gaming industry. It combines gaming and finance, allowing players to earn income in virtual worlds and participate in game governance and ecosystem building. This mode brings new business models and revenue opportunities to the gaming industry, while providing players with more participation and value.



## SocialFi

SocialFi is an emerging field that combines social media and decentralized finance (DeFi). By integrating social networks and financial tools, it provides users with more convenient, interesting and personalized financial services. The goal of SocialFi is to make financial services more socialized while utilizing the advantages of decentralization, security and transparency brought by blockchain technology.

To help you better understand SocialFi, we can metaphore it as a financial social party. At this party, you can not only communicate with friends and family, but also participate in various financial activities together, such as investment, lending and trading. In this way, financial services become more friendly and fun.

A typical application of SocialFi is social tokens. Social tokens are cryptocurrencies issued by communities or individuals that represent the value and trust between community members. Users can participate in community activities by purchasing, holding and trading these tokens, such as voting, obtaining privileges or sharing profits. For example, a musician can issue his own social tokens, fans buy these tokens to support the musician, and get privileges like albums, concert tickets, etc.

In addition, SocialFi also includes a series of social network-based financial tools and services, such as decentralized prediction markets, social investment portfolios, and community governance. These tools and services make the financial market more transparent, fair and inclusive, allowing more people to participate and benefit.

SocialFi is an emerging field that combines social media and decentralized finance. By integrating social networks and financial tools, SocialFi provides users with more convenient, interesting and personalized financial services. It is expected to change our perception of financial services and make the financial market more socialized, fair and inclusive.



## Token

A token is a digital asset based on blockchain technology, usually used to represent a certain value or right. In the cryptocurrency world, tokens can be used to exchange goods, services or as investment tools. Unlike cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), tokens are usually created based on existing blockchain platforms (such as Ethereum) rather than having independent blockchain networks.

The applications of tokens are wide-ranging, including: Utility Tokens are used to access specific services or applications; Governance Tokens are used to participate in project decision making; and Security Tokens represent ownership of real assets (such as stocks, real estate, etc.). Therefore, when investing in tokens, understanding the underlying project and value is very important.



## Whale

A whale refers to an investor who holds a large amount of digital currencies or tokens. These investors have very large assets, so their trading behavior may have a significant impact on market prices. When whales buy or sell large amounts of tokens, market prices may rise or fall rapidly, attracting the attention and following of other investors.



## DID (Decentralized Identity)

When talking about DID (Decentralized Identity) in blockchain, you can think of it as a digital identity credential that can help us securely verify and manage personal identity information on the Internet. Traditional identity verification methods usually require trusted third-party institutions, such as banks or governments, but DID uses blockchain technology to make the identity verification process more decentralized and transparent.

A DID is a unique identifier consisting of a long string of numbers and letters, similar to your identity card number in real life. However, unlike ID cards, DIDs are not issued by a central authority but are self-created and controlled by individuals. This means you can manage and control your own identity information without an intermediary.

For example, imagine that you want to register an account on an online social platform. Typically, you need to provide a lot of personal information, including name, address, phone number, etc., and then submit this information to the platform for verification and storage. However, this approach poses risks to privacy and security because you do not have full control over your data.

Using a DID, you can create your own digital identity and store the required verification information on the blockchain. The platform only needs to verify that your DID is valid without directly accessing your personal information. This way, your identity information is not centrally stored in one place but is dispersedly stored on different nodes of the blockchain, greatly reducing the risk of data being hacked or misused by hackers.

In addition, DID allows you to reuse your identity information in different scenarios. Imagine that you want to rent a car, usually you need to provide documents such as a driver's license, credit card, and other identity information. But with a DID, you only need to go through one verification process, and then use your digital identity for authentication in multiple scenarios, from car rental companies to hotels to airlines, avoiding the hassle of repeatedly filling in and verifying personal information.

In summary, DID is an innovative digital identity verification method that enables decentralized and secure management of personal identity information through blockchain technology. It provides higher privacy protection and convenience to the Internet, allowing individuals to better control their own identity data.



## Seed Phrase

A seed phrase is a group of 12 to 24 words that is used to recover access to an encrypted cryptocurrency wallet. When you create a new digital wallet, the system generates a unique seed phrase derived from the private key. So it is as important as the private key. These words are like keys that allow you to control and access the assets in your wallet.

Note that the seed phrase is extremely important! Be sure to keep it safe and avoid disclosing it to others. Once someone else gets your seed phrase, they can easily control your assets. For security, it is recommended to write down the seed phrase on paper and keep it in a safe place.



## IDO

IDO (Initial DEX Offering) is a way for cryptocurrency projects to raise funds. It is similar to IPO (Initial Public Offering) in traditional stock markets, but it occurs on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The purpose of IDO is to raise funds for new projects and provide liquidity and initial pricing for project tokens.

Let's use a simple analogy to understand IDO. Imagine that a startup company (such as an innovative cryptocurrency project) wants to raise funds to support its business development. In the traditional stock market, this company can choose to conduct an IPO to sell its stocks to the public. In the cryptocurrency market, this company can choose to conduct an IDO to sell its tokens to the public through decentralized exchanges.

The general process of conducting an IDO is as follows:

1. The project party selects a decentralized exchange to conduct the IDO. This exchange needs to provide a platform for initiating IDOs, such as PancakeSwap, Uniswap, etc.
2. The project party determines the conditions of the IDO, including token price, total issuance, fundraising goals, etc. This information needs to be publicly transparent to allow investors to understand the basic information about the project.
3. When the IDO begins, investors can purchase tokens issued by the project party. This process is usually first come, first served, and purchase limits are sometimes set to prevent a single investor from occupying a large number of tokens.
4. After the IDO ends, the project party will use the raised funds for project development, marketing, etc. At the same time, tokens held by investors can be traded on decentralized exchanges. In this way, the token price is determined by the market supply and demand, forming a free market price.

IDO is a way for cryptocurrency projects to raise funds on decentralized exchanges. Through IDO, new projects can raise funds, distribute tokens, and provide liquidity and initial pricing for tokens. Compared to traditional IPOs, this approach has advantages such as lower barriers, higher transparency and faster trading speed. However, IDO may also bring higher risks because the cryptocurrency market is relatively new and there may be deficiencies in regulation and market stability. When participating in IDO, investors need to carefully evaluate the potential value and risks of the project.



## ICO

ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a way for cryptocurrency projects to raise funds, similar to IPO (Initial Public Offering) in traditional stock markets. Through ICO, new projects can raise funds to support their development and issue tokens to investors. These tokens often have certain utility, such as using within the project's ecosystem or as governance interests.

For example, imagine that a startup company (such as a cryptocurrency project) wants to raise funds to support its business development. In the traditional stock market, this company can choose to conduct an IPO to sell its stocks to the public. In the cryptocurrency market, this company can choose to conduct an ICO to sell its tokens to the public.

The general process of conducting an ICO is as follows:

1. The project party publishes a white paper detailing the background, goals, technical architecture and other information about the project. The purpose of the white paper is to allow investors to understand the basics of the project and evaluate its potential value.
2. The project party determines the terms of the ICO, including token price, total issuance, fundraising goals, etc. This information needs to be publicly transparent to allow investors to understand the basics of the project.
3. When the ICO begins, investors can purchase tokens issued by the project party. This process is usually first come, first served, and purchase limits are sometimes set to prevent a single investor from occupying a large number of tokens.
4. After the ICO ends, the project party will use the raised funds for project development, marketing, etc. At the same time, tokens held by investors can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. In this way, the token price is determined by the market supply and demand, forming a free market price.

ICO is a way for cryptocurrency projects to raise funds. Through ICO, new projects can raise funds, distribute tokens, and provide liquidity for tokens. Compared with traditional IPOs, this approach has advantages such as lower barriers, higher transparency and faster trading speeds. However, at the same time, ICO may also bring higher risks because the cryptocurrency market is relatively new and there may be deficiencies in regulation and market stability. When participating in ICO, investors need to carefully evaluate the potential value and risks of the project.



## IPO

An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a company first offers its stocks for sale to the public on the stock market. Through IPO, a company can raise funds to support its business development while providing an investment opportunity for investors. IPO is an important way to turn a private company into a publicly listed company.

Let's use a simple analogy to understand IPO. Imagine that you and your friends created a company. Initially, the company only belonged to a few founders. Over time, the company succeeded and business expanded continuously. You decided to raise more funds to support the sustained development of the company. One feasible method is to sell the company's stocks to the public through IPO on the stock market. This way, the company can raise funds while investors have the opportunity to share in the company's future profits.

The general process of conducting an IPO is as follows:

1. The company decides to conduct an IPO and hires investment banks and other professional institutions to prepare for the IPO. This includes writing a prospectus, auditing financial statements, etc.
2. The company submits the prospectus and related documents to regulators, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulators will review the submitted documents to ensure that they meet regulatory requirements.
3. After the review is approved, the company determines the details of the IPO, including stock issue price, issue quantity, listed exchange, etc.
4. When the IPO begins, investors can purchase stocks issued by the company. Typically, the initial price of stocks is jointly determined by investment banks and the company, while the subsequent stock price is determined by the market supply and demand.
5. After the IPO ends, the company successfully goes public, and its stocks are publicly traded on the exchange. Investors can buy and sell company stocks to share in the company's growth and profits.

In summary, an IPO is the process by which a company first offers its stocks for sale to the public on the stock market. Through IPO, a company can raise funds to support business development while providing investors with an opportunity to share profits. Companies conducting IPOs need to follow strict regulatory requirements and review processes to ensure that investors' interests are protected.



## OTC

OTC (Over-The-Counter) refers to transactions conducted outside of exchanges. Unlike transactions conducted on exchanges, OTC transactions are usually conducted directly between the parties without going through a central exchange. This trading method is applied to financial products such as stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.

If you want to buy a used car. Buying on an exchange is like going to an organized used car market where there are many sellers, buyers and intermediaries (such as exchanges) involved, and the prices and trading rules are standardized and public. Conducting OTC transactions is like buying a used car through private channels. You can communicate directly with the car owner to negotiate the price and trade terms.

The characteristics of OTC transactions are:

- Flexibility: OTC transactions allow the parties to freely negotiate the terms of the transaction according to their own needs, such as price, quantity, settlement method, etc. This flexibility makes OTC transactions more attractive in some cases.
- Privacy: OTC transactions are not as publicly transparent as transactions on exchanges. The parties can maintain the privacy of the transaction. This may be beneficial in some cases, such as large transactions, sensitive information transactions, etc.
- Risk: Because OTC transactions do not go through the central exchange, the credit risk between the parties may be higher. To reduce risks, participants may need to conduct additional credit investigations or use third-party guarantee institutions.
- Regulatory difficulty: The decentralization of OTC transactions makes regulation more difficult. Therefore, in some cases, OTC transactions may be more susceptible to manipulation, fraud and other misconduct.

However, at the same time, OTC transactions may also bring higher risks and regulatory difficulties.

After other consumers see your advertisement, they can contact you to negotiate the transaction details.

- Risk: Because C2C transactions do not go through merchants, transaction security may be lower. To reduce risks, consumers need to evaluate counterparties and use secure payment methods. At the same time, the platform party also needs to take certain measures, such as real-name registration, credit rating, etc., to ensure transaction security.
